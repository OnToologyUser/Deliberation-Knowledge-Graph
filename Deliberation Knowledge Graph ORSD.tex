\section{Related Ontologies for Deliberation}

\subsection{Existing Ontologies and Their Limitations}

\subsubsection{DELIB Ontology (Porwol et al., 2014)}
\textbf{Purpose:} Models e-participation deliberation process with social media integration.\\
\textbf{Pros:} Explicitly supports dual e-participation (government and citizen-led); connects deliberation with social media content; comprehensive conceptualization of topic, claim, argument structure.\\
\textbf{Cons:} Focused primarily on electronic participation; lacks detailed representation of legal frameworks; limited implementation examples.

\subsubsection{Deliberation Ontology (Panagiotopoulos et al., 2011)}
\textbf{Purpose:} Supports public decision making in policy deliberations.\\
\textbf{Pros:} Strong focus on legal information integration; connects arguments with legal sources; emphasizes bureaucratic process modeling.\\
\textbf{Cons:} Government-centric approach; limited participant modeling; does not account for informal deliberation spaces.

\subsubsection{SIOC (Semantically Interlinked Online Communities)}
\textbf{Purpose:} Describes online discussion information structure.\\
\textbf{Pros:} Well-established standard; robust representation of online discussions; widely used in social media applications.\\
\textbf{Cons:} Not specifically designed for deliberation; lacks political and legal conceptualization; no deliberation-specific reasoning capabilities.

\subsubsection{AIF (Argument Interchange Format)}
\textbf{Purpose:} Represents argument structure and relations.\\
\textbf{Pros:} Sophisticated argument modeling; captures support/attack relationships; strong theoretical foundation.\\
\textbf{Cons:} Complex for non-expert users; focused only on argumentation, not broader deliberation processes; limited integration with other aspects of deliberation.

\subsubsection{LKIF (Legal Knowledge Interchange Format)}
\textbf{Purpose:} Facilitates communication between legal knowledge systems.\\
\textbf{Pros:} Comprehensive legal information modeling; supports complex legal reasoning; structured legal source representation.\\
\textbf{Cons:} Highly specialized for legal domain; overly complex for general deliberation needs; lacks direct connection to civic participation concepts.

\subsubsection{IBIS (Issue-Based Information System)}
\textbf{Purpose:} Models issues, positions, and arguments.\\
\textbf{Pros:} Simple, intuitive structure; explicitly separates issues, positions, and arguments; widely used in design rationale.\\
\textbf{Cons:} Limited expressivity for complex deliberations; no participant or process modeling; lacks temporal dimension.

\subsection{Why a New Deliberation Knowledge Graph is Needed}

Despite the availability of multiple ontologies in related domains, a unified Deliberation Knowledge Graph is necessary for several reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Integration Gap:} None of the existing ontologies adequately bridges formal institutional deliberation with civic participation platforms. The DKG addresses this by creating mappings between these domains.
    
    \item \textbf{Fallacy Detection Support:} Existing ontologies lack the specific structures required for computational identification of logical fallacies in deliberative discourse. The DKG explicitly models argument patterns needed for automated fallacy detection.
    
    \item \textbf{Cross-Dataset Standardization:} Current deliberation data exists in heterogeneous formats across platforms. The DKG provides a common semantic framework to normalize and integrate these diverse datasets.
    
    \item \textbf{Fragmentation:} Each existing ontology covers only part of the deliberation ecosystem. The DKG provides a comprehensive framework that connects process, participants, content, and information in a coherent structure.
    
    \item \textbf{Interoperability Challenges:} Current solutions operate in silos, making cross-platform analysis difficult. The DKG establishes common semantics to enable data sharing across different deliberation environments.
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-perspective Integration:} Existing approaches typically adopt either a government-centric or citizen-centric perspective. The DKG supports multiple viewpoints simultaneously.
    
    \item \textbf{Technical Evolution:} New deliberation platforms and technologies emerge regularly. The DKG's modular approach allows extension to incorporate new deliberation forms while maintaining backward compatibility.
    
    \item \textbf{Research-Practice Gap:} Current ontologies are either too theoretical or too implementation-specific. The DKG balances conceptual rigor with practical applicability.
\end{enumerate}

The Deliberation Knowledge Graph addresses these limitations by providing a unifying semantic layer that leverages the strengths of existing ontologies while filling their gaps through a comprehensive approach to deliberation modeling. Specifically, it adds crucial support for fallacy detection and cross-dataset integration that has been missing from previous ontological approaches.
