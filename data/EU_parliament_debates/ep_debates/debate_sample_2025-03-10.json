We mark a sad anniversary today as our hearts go out to the victims, to those who lost their loved ones and to the injured who still bear the scars of that day. This House remembers them and honours them.\nOver the coming months, we will celebrate also the 35th anniversary of the assertion of state continuity of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, enshrining their independence de jure under international law throughout different illegal occupations and annexations of the 20th century.\nThese anniversaries remind us again of the sacrifice of so many for the liberty that we enjoy today, and underscore our determination never to allow another generation of Europeans to be lost behind an Iron Curtain.\nTomorrow at noon, we will once again welcome national leader of Belarus, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, to this plenary, along with other brave women from Ukraine and Belarus, who are standing up for liberty in order to mark International Women's Day. May I ask that you are present. I count on you and your colleagues to be here then, because this week will also serve to reaffirm this House's steadfast support for the people of Belarus and their struggle for freedom, including political prisoners.\nAnd to express this solidarity and to mark the International Day of Solidarity with Belarus, the European Parliament is once again offering you, as Members of this Parliament, the opportunity to sign postcards addressed to the 1 250 political prisoners who are unfairly imprisoned by Lukashenka's regime. I urge you to join in this action to show them that their sacrifice will not remain unanswered.\nLast year, this initiative was extremely successful – in the previous mandate, in the previous Parliament. I ask that we make this year's even more so. We know their names, we see their struggle and we stand with them. So this message and this initiative will send the strongest of messages that they are not alone.\n(Applause)",
